<h2>Greg Heffley's Creator "Jeff Kinney" wrote the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. It’s really funny, even when I reread sentences I still find them funny. It is also funny becuase of Greg Heffley. He is hilarious and my favourite. Fregley is this crazy kid who lives across the street and I’m always shocked at what he does. It’s funny but always strange when he’s around. Greg’s best friend Rowley is also one of my favourites, but he’s not as smart as Greg, but he makes up for it with enthusiasm.</h2>
